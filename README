This is the main repository for the karimganj college's
alumni association platform called alumni connect which is
web-based fullstack application for interacting with our
college's alumni from various departments and view events
regarding those events.

For the active developers of this project. Here are some basic
code of conduct and is must be followed from top to bottom:
1. all documents go to their respective directory.
2. we use bootstrap 4.1.3 since it's the latest LTS version.
3. optimization should be held at the weekends of each week
instead of premature optimization.
4. for any problem regarding any issue either contact me via the
group or search online.
