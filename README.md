This is the main repository for the karimganj college's  
alumni association platform called alumni connect which is  
web-based fullstack application for interacting with our  
college's alumni from various departments and view events  
regarding those events.

For the active developers of this project. Here are some basic  
code of conduct and is must be followed from top to bottom:
1. all documents go to their respective directory.
2. we use bootstrap 4.1.3 since it's the latest LTS version.
3. optimization should be held at the weekends of each week 
instead of premature optimization.  
4. for any problem regarding any issue either contact me via the
group or search online.  


`General Directory Structure`

scripts/

└── js/

└── styles.css
```

For now there is no php in the `scritps` directory  
but on further development it is recommended to use  
this `php` directory for better organization and  
debugging.  

All else is self-explanatory


Here are our current todo/goals:
- [ ] Make `basic` front end for all pages regarding this project
